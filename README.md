## Conveyor Belt Pricer
### Simple Program Introducing Objects
This project is meant to introduce the use of Objects in Java. 
The program will calculate the area of the conveyor belt being ordered and then check to see what the price should be, based on that area. 
* Please note, only ConveyorBelt.java is my code here. The ConveyorBeltPricer.java file was provided by my professor.
